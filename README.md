# PoseidonZRGB
Attempting to set the LED colours from code !

This project is an attempt to set the colours of the TTeSports Poseidon Z keyboard's LEDs.
NOW WORKING ON WINDOWS !!!

I begun developing this because I find the official software of ThermalTake's Poseidon Z to be utter garbage, as it lacks any form of customisation, and appears to have had it's UI designed by 12-year old kids.
The point of my software is not really to provide an alternative, but to provide instead a way of personalising the keyboard. The light feature I wanted most on this keyboard was a cross between the "Reactive", and "Static-Backlit" light modes. I figured that if I could find a way to control the LED's from code, then I'd have complete control over how it looks, and could make it exactly as I wanted. Thanks to this software, I made it possible to mix these two light-modes,
and am planning to add more in future!

Currently the project is completely in development. It doesn't actually do anything special yet.
