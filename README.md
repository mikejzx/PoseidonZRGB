# PoseidonZRGB
Attempting to set the LED colours from code !

This project is an attempt to set the colours of the TTeSports Poseidon Z keyboard's LEDs. 
Currently, the project only works on Linux. Windows for some reason will not send the friggin' HID packets to the keyboard.

# Please don't run this program until a stable build is released!
Currently the project is completely in development. It doesn't actually do anything special *yet*.
