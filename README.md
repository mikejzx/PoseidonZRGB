# PoseidonZRGB

Note: this project is no longer in development.

This is simply an LED controller for the TTeSports Poseidon Z RGB keyboard.  This was written because I found the official software to be severely lacking in both functionality on customisability.

The software is functional, however, as it updates the keyboard RGBs on a periodic basis, there is some flicker that may be annoying. 

Lighting modes:

* Backlit
* Backlit+reactive
* Wave
* "Global wave"

I don't recommend actually using this software.
